scala-programming-learnings
===========================

For now, this is just a place for me to record my learnings as I follow along in
[Programming in Scala, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step-Step/dp/0981531644)

While it was written against scala 2.8, I'm using 2.10 to follow along. Already a few deprecated
methods used in the book have been removed and replaced with newer alternatives.

Maybe it could turn into something more, maybe that something more will be in another repository.  
We'll see.
